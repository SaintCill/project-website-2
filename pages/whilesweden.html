            <div class="content-packing">
                <h2>Packing:</h2>
                <p>If you are heading to Sweden during winter, especially northern Sweden,<br>
                     you are going to need to pack like you are going on a skiing trip.<br>
                    During January - February you can expect to encounter temperatures<br> 
                    as low as -30°C or -22°F if you are American.</p>
                <p>Packing for such weather is essential if you are planning on leaving your hotel.<br>
                    Those of you who live in warmer climates, where such winter clothing is harder to get,<br>
                    don't fret, there is an alternative.</p>
                <p>If you are unable to get a hold of some clothes that will keep you warm <br>
                    in northern Sweden's temperatures, I suggest setting aside some additional spending <br>
                    cash. There are many cheap stores with quality winter clothing here in Sweden. We'll be<br>
                    listing some below.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Once You Get Here...</h2>
            <div class="content-shopping">
                <h2>Shopping for Essentials:</h2>
                <p>So you made it to northern Sweden, you've checked into your hotel and now you are ready to <br>
                    tackle the northern tundra. Great! Now is the time to check for a few essentials if you got a hold<br>
                    of winter clothes before arriving. First and most important would be your shoes. If you are wearing<br>
                    sneakers or something similar, I would recommend getting some winter boots. You will also want some <br>
                    thick socks, preferably wool. Trust me, you will regret going out if you don't have proper footwear.<br>
                    <br>Check below for more details!</p>
                
                <details id="in-general">
                    <summary>In General:</summary>
                    <h2>In General:</h2>
                    <p>For your hands, I recommend some winter gloves. Even if you don't wear them everyday, they are going to be<br>
                    the MVP of the trip if you have to use your hands while out and about. A thick scarf might also be in<br>
                    your shopping list if you didn't bring one, but this is more dependent on the weather. During the early<br>
                    winter months, as well as March, you will get away with not wearing one. During the colder months however,<br>
                    you will be swearing like a pissed off Viking if you don't have one.<br>
                    <br>
                    Also get a proper winter hat, or your complaining will annoy the rest of the group.<br>
                    Some cheap alternatives include:</p>

                    <h2>For Explorers:</h2>
                    <p>Before heading out and exploring the tundra, you are going to want to get some long johns. If you are <br>
                        planning on going out into nature, the long johns will provide the first of three layers against the <br>
                        cold. That is right, three layers. It might seem excessive, but take the word of someone who has lived <br>
                        here for years, you would rather be a bit too hot than freezing. Even if you are just wandering through <br>
                        trails, you might encounter a situation that requires you to wade through snow, so at least bring them <br>
                        with you if you are planning on going outside. Snowshoes are optional. They are handy, but I've walked my <br>
                        way through snow-covered forests more than once without snowshoes, so it's really up to you if you want to <br>
                        bring some.
